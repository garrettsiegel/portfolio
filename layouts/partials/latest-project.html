  <h3>The Brockulator: <br/>How quickly do 31 QBs earn Purdyâ€™s $870K?</h3>
  <p>In this project, I led the front-end development in a Hugo build, teaming up with designers to achieve a pixel-perfect UI. Using HTML, SASS, and Vanilla JavaScript, I engineered synchronized scrolling and dynamic data updates for NFL quarterback salary visualizations. The launch drew over 500K viewers and secured the top spot on ESPN.com.</p>
